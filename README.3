This archive contains programs to convert the MSDOS interrupt list into
hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems.
These programs have been contributed by others; I have not tested them
because I do not own any of the help systems for which they produce
databases.  If you have problems, please contact the author of the
program with which you experienced difficulties.  Some of these
programs are fairly old, and may not work properly with the current
version of the interrupt list due to recent enhancements to the list's
format.

INTERVUE.EXE, INTLIST.ICO, and IV.BAT are the files for the
public-domain interrupt list viewer from Hackensack.  IV.BAT is a
wrapper which ensures that the necessary index file exists before
invoking INTERVUE.

In addition, the source code for INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the Epsilon
extension code I use while editing the list are now included in this
archive.
