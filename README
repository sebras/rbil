Due to the growing size of the list, I will be splitting the distribution
archive beginning with the next release.  Along with this split, I will
be changing the naming of the archives.  Instead of INTERnyy, they will
be named INTERrrA and INTERrrB, where rr is the release number.  Thus,
the next release will be INTER26A and INTER26B instead of INTER391.
