		XT, AT and PS/2	 I/O port addresses

Do NOT consider this information to be complete and accurate.  If you want
to do hardware programming ALWAYS check the appropriate data sheets (but
even they are sometimes in error!).  Be aware that erroneous port programming
can put your data or even your hardware at risk.

There are a number of memory-mapped addresses in use for I/O; see MEMORY.LST
for details on memory-mapped I/O.

--------!---Note-----------------------------
Note: the port description format is:

PPPPw RW  description

where:	PPPP	is the four-digit hex port number or a plus sign and three hex
		digits to indicate an offset from a base port address
	w	is blank for byte-size port, 'w' for word, and 'd' for dword
	R	is blank or dash if not readable, 'r' if sometimes readable,
		'R' if "always" readable, '?' if readability unknown
	W	is blank or dash if not writable, 'w' if sometimes writable,
		'W' if "always" writable, 'C' if write-clear, and
		'?' if writability unknown

	During normal operation mode (8253) 40h-42h set the counter values on
	write and get the current counter value on read. In 16bit modes two
	consequtive writes/reads must be issued, first with the low byte,
	followed by the high byte. In 8254 read back modes, all selected
	counters and status are latched and must be read out completely
	before normal operation is valid again.	 Each counter switches back
	to normal operation after read out.  In 'get status and counter'
	mode the first byte read is the status, followed by one or two
	counter values. (see #P088)
0043  RW  PIT  mode port, control word register for counters 0-2 (see #P089)

Notes:	XL-220/221 are based on LOGIC Devices L53C80JC4 SCSI controller which
	  is compatible with Symbios Logic (formaerly NCR) 53C80
	each SCSI data pin is inverted and compared with correcponding bit
	  in the ID select register; if any matches are found while a bus free
	  condition exists and SEL is active, SCSI controller will genarate an
	  interrupt to indicate a selection or reselection
	pseudo-DMA register is provided by some on-card PLM, and decodes any
	  address in the range 01x8-01xF; it should be accessed with 16-bit
	  I/O instructions only causing 2 SCSI REQ/ACK hanshakes (8-bit I/O
	  is treated as 16-bit, and second byte is lost); delayed assertion of
	  the REQ signal or bus free condition on the SCSI bus causes the
	  pseudo-DMA register to prolong ISA I/O cycle not asserting IOCHRDY
	  signal (SCSI phase mismatch doesn't), and so may cause ISA bus to
	  hang in not ready state!

	the drive ordering implemented in BIOS versions 3.4 and 3.5 is the
	  opposite of the order (currently) used by the rest of the SCSI
	  industry--for example, under DOS SCSI ID 0 will be D: and SCSI ID 1
	  will be C:
	Future Domain TMC-16x0 SCSI adapter series are based upon Future Domain
	  TMC-1800/18C50/18C30 SCSI controllers
	TMC-1800/18C50/18C30 are ISA SCSI controllers, TMC-36C70 is a PCI
	  version of TMC-18C30
	TMC-1800/18C50 have 8K FIFO, TMC-18C30/36C70 have 2K FIFO
	Future Domain TMC-1650/1660/1670/1680/1610M/1610MER/1610MEX SCSI
	  adapters are based on TMC-1800/18C50/18C30
	Quantum ISA-200S/250MG SCSI adapters are based on TMC-18C50 (?)
	Future Domain TMC-3260 and Adaptec AHA-2920 PCI SCSI adapters are
	  based on TMC-36C70

Notes:	any value written into the write loopback register can be read back
	  from the read loopback register unchanged (this is used by the BIOS
	  to test the controller)
	reading from read SCSI data register and writing to write SCSI data
	  register causes REQ/ACK handshake to occur automatically, reading
	  and writing the SCSI data no ACK register doesn't
	SCSI FIFO may be used only for DATA IN / DATA OUT phase transfers on
	  TMC-1800; on TMC-18C50/18C30 it may also be used for COMMAND phase
	  transfers

Format of AHA-154x mailbox array:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table P213)
 00h  N*4 BYTEs	array of N "out" mailboxes (see #P214)
 N*4  N*4 BYTEs	array of N "in" mailboxes (see #P214)
Notes:	the "out" mailboxes are scanned by the host adapter in a round-robin
	  fashion, i.e. the host adapter first looks into an "out" mailbox
	  which follows one least recently used (and wraps around if it was
	  the last one in the array)
	array of "in" mailboxes is absent in the case of BIOS mailboxes

----------P0380038C--------------------------
PORT 0380-038C - 2nd SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) adapter
Notes:	Initialization of the SDLC adapter is performed in a typical
	  sequence like this: Setup 8255 port A-C configuration by writing
	  98h to 383h, followed by initializing 8255 port C by writing 0Dh
	  to 382h. Reset 8273 internal registers by pulsing 8255 port B4.
	  After this the 8253 has to be programmed to the desired values
	  (counter 0 in mode 3). Now the 8273 is ready to be configured for
	  the operating mode that defines the communication environment in
	  which it will be used.
	Note on 8273: Each 8273 protocol controllers internal register is
	  programmed by individual set/reset commands (via 388h) in
	  conjunction with a parameter (via 389h) that give an OR/AND mask
	  to the internal register value.
	  Although the 8273 is a full duplex device, there is only one
	  command register. Thus, the command register must be used for
	  only one command sequence at a time and the transmitter and
	  receiver may never be simultaneously in a command phase.
	  The system software starts the command phase by writing a command
	  byte into the command register. If further information is required
	  by the 8273 prior to execution of the command, the system software
	  must write the list of parameters into the parameter register.

PORT 03A0-03AF - 1st BSC (Binary Synchronous Communication) adapter
Notes:	Initialization of the BSC adapter is performed in a typical
	  sequence like this: Setup 8255 port A-C configuration by writing
	  98h to 383h, followed by initializing 8255 port C by writing 0Dh
	  to 382h. Reset 8251A internal registers by pulsing 8255 port B4.
	  After this the 8253 has to be programmed to the desired values
	  (counter 0 not used, counters 1 and 2 to mode 0). Now, the 8251A
	  is ready to be loaded with a set of control words that define the
	  communication environment.
	8251A: The control words are split into two formats, mode
	  instruction and command instruction. The mode instruction must
	  be inserted immediately after a reset operation (via 8255 port B4
	  or setting command instruction bit6 to 'internal reset').
	  The required synchronization characters are next loaded into the
	  8251A (usually 32h for BSC). All control words written to the
	  8251A after this will load the command instruction.

Notes:	registers 10h and 11h have varying uses on VGA (see #P286) and
	  MCGA (see #P287)
	MDA, HGC, CGA: 6845 registers 00h-0Dh are write only, 0Eh, 0Fh
	       are r/w, and 10h-11h are read only.
	       The alternative initial defaults may be used
	       sometimes on modern adapters.
	HGC+(RamFont): as with HGC, but 3 additional registers for font control
	emulations   : more registers may be r/w, but most often it's the
	       same as with native 6845.
	MCGA (CGA+)  : Though this is a mixture of CGA and VGA, most
	       registers are same as with CGA, but with some
	       enhancements and incompatibilities to EGA, VGA.
	native EGA   : registers 00h-0Bh are write only, 0Ch-0Fh are
	       r/w, 10h-11h are read/write, 12h-18h are write
	       only. More regs may be r/w on enhanced clones.
	GenoaSuperEGA: adapter with chips SEQCRT GN006001 and GRAT
	       GN006002, e.g. c't Super-EGA adapter. Is EGA
	       clone with up to 800x600 and full 6845 emulation.
	native VGA   : all registers 00-18h are r/w, but 00h-07h are
	       write-locked if bit7 in 11h is set.
	ET4000	     : same as VGA, but with additional r/w registers
	       32h-37h, protected by 'key' except 33h, 35h
	       (see 3BFh for details). 35h is protected by
	       bit7 in 11h. The 'key' must be issued at least
	       after each power on or synchronous reset.
