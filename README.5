This is the fifth of five archives containing the MSDOS Interrupt List,
release 45.

This archive contains programs to convert the MSDOS interrupt list into
hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems.
These programs have been contributed by others; I have not tested them
because I do not own any of the help systems for which they produce
databases.  If you have problems, please contact the author of the
program with which you experienced difficulties.  Some of these programs
predate, and will thus not take advantage of, recent enhancements to the
list's format.

INTERVUE.EXE, INTLIST.ICO, and IV.BAT are the files for the
public-domain interrupt list viewer from Hackensack.  IV.BAT is a
wrapper which ensures that the necessary index file exists before
invoking INTERVUE.  The interrupt list has now exceeded the limits of
INTERVUE v1.5's capabilities; the included v1.6 is a quick patch of
v1.4 (Bob Williamson was unable to locate the sources for v1.5)
which allocates more memory in order to be able to load the index
file.  Hopefully, the planned new version will be forthcoming before
this version reaches its limits.  INTPRINT has already been enhanced to
support the upcoming enhanced version of INTERVUE.

In addition, the source code for INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the Epsilon
extension code I use while editing the list are included in this
archive.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current version was 3.5
(IL2HDK35).

I have removed INT2HLP.BAT, L2WH.ZIP, and WINHELP.ZIP from the
distribution, since the first is a slow (and old) Perl script to
generate a Windows Help file, the second is a slow AWK script to
generate a Windows Help file, and the third is a slow AWK script
processing the output of INT2HLP.BAT.  Since there is another WinHelp
generator in the archive and IL2HDK is also available, I decided to
remove those three in order to reduce the size of the archive.

Similarly, I have removed NGCONVER.ZIP because it duplicates RB2NG
but appears to have less functionality.
