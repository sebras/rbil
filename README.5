This is the fifth of six archives containing the MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 51.

This archive contains programs to convert the MS-DOS interrupt list
into hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems
(other than WinHelp, which is in a separate archive).  These programs
have been contributed by others; I have not tested them because I do
not own any of the help systems for which they produce databases.  If
you have problems, please contact the author of the program with which
you experienced difficulties.  Some of these programs predate, and will
thus not take advantage of, recent enhancements to the list's format.
THESE CONVERSION UTILITIES ARE NOT STAND-ALONE PRODUCTS!  You must have
the appropriate help system compiler to create an actual hypertext
database which can be read by the help system; these are not included
because they are commercial products.

INTERVUE, the public-domain interrupt list viewer from Hackensack, has
been dropped from the interrupt list distribution because the interrupt
list outgrew it and a newer version has not been forthcoming.  Instead,
Interrupt Helper, Interrupt Summary, and IVIEW are offered in this
archive.  Interrupt Summary is designed to be keystroke-compatible with
INTERVUE, while offering additional functionality.  IVIEW is designed
to conserve disk space by not requiring any additional index files and
by itself being as compact as possible (under 2K!).

In addition, the source code for COMBINE, INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the
Epsilon extension code I use while editing the list are included in
this archive.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current version was 3.5
(IL2HDK35).
