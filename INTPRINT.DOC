hope that proper credit will be retained in all copies and derivatives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTPRINT.COM is a simple formatter for the interrupt list.  Use this
program to print only a portion of the list, prevent widow lines at the
beginning of a function call, number the pages, boldface key portions,
center the printout, or create a summary of the function calls.  After
formatting is complete, the total number of pages is displayed on the
screen.

Usage:
   intprint [options] intlist [[>|>>]outfile]

where the options are:
        -b    boldface the title lines, Return:, and Notes: by overprinting
        -B    boldface by sending printer control sequences

	-d    (duplex) print even/odd pages with different margins; suitable
	      for binding the printout.

        -e    assume printer is in elite mode (96 characters per line), and
	      indent the output eight spaces to center the printout.  This
	      is primarily for the default printer, as other printers may
	      force the equivalent or override this option.

        -ffile  create a file containing only the data structures described
              in the interrupt list.
	      NOTE: you must put the filename immediately after the 'f'; no
              blanks are allowed.

	-Ffile  filter the listing based on include and exclude strings
	      in 'file'.  Only entries whose headers match none of the
	      exclude strings and at least one of the include strings
	      will be processed.  All others will be skipped.
	      NOTE: you must put the filename immediately after the 'F'; no
              blanks are allowed.

	-H    print a heading on each page indicating which interrupts
	      are listed on the page

        -iN   indent the output N spaces.  The output device is assumed to be
              at least 80+N characters wide.
	      NOTE: you must put the number immediately after the 'i'; no
              blanks are allowed.

	-I    assume the printer is capable of producing IBM character
	      graphics.  Printers other than "default" may force this option.

	-lN   print N lines per pages, overriding the printer-specific
	      default.
	-LN   assume N lines on a page.  If this is more than the number of
	      lines to print on each page, INTPRINT will use line feeds to
	      advance to the next page instead of form feeds.

	-m    specify that the interrupt list is in multiple parts beginning
	      with the named file.  INTPRINT will increment the last
	      character of the name to get the next filename, and continue
	      until it is unable to open the file thus selected.

        -nN   assume N pages have already been printed, and start numbering
              at N+1.  This option allows you to create a properly-numbered
              printout even if there is not enough disk space to concatenate
	      the parts of the interrupt list or hold a complete output file.
	      See the examples below.
	      NOTE: you must put the number immediately after the 'n'; no
              blanks are allowed.

        -p    print the page number at the bottom center of each page

	-Pname use control codes for the specified printer (-P? lists the
	      supported printers).  The printer name may be given in either
	      case and abbreviated to a unique prefix; use either dashes or
	      underscores in place of blanks in the printer name.

	-rN:M print only pages N through M.  The entire input is processed
	      for use in -s and -f summaries (see below) even though only
	      a portion is formatted for printing.  If filtering is enabled,
	      (see -F), page numbers are based on entries selected by the
	      filter file.
	      NOTE: you must put the page numbers immediately after the 'r';
	      no blanks are allowed.

        -sfile  create a one-line-per-function summary and write it to "file"
              if -n is also given, the summary will be appended to "file",
              allowing a properly numbered summary file to be created even if
              there is not enough disk space to concatenate the parts of the
              list.  See the examples below.
	      NOTE: you must put the filename immediately after the 's'; no
              blanks are allowed.

	-tN   select typeface N for the chosen printer (currently supported
	      only for the HP).

	-wN   (widow lines) search N lines from the end of the page for a
	      good place to break.  The default is ten lines; the valid
	      range is from 3 to one-half of the page length.
	      NOTE: you must put the number immediately after the 'w'; no
              blanks are allowed.

Options may not be combined; "-ep" is illegal and the "p" will be ignored.

The formatted result of the input file is sent to the specified output file,
or to standard output if no output file is given.  Standard output may be
redirected using the usual Unix or MSDOS redirection characters > or >>.  If
you only want a summary file or data formats file, send or redirect the
output to the null device ("NUL" under MSDOS, "/dev/null" under Unix).


FILTER FILE:
------------

The filter file specified with -F is a simple text file containing
include lines, exclude lines, and comment lines.  Include lines start
with a plus sign (+) in the first column, followed immediately by the
desired string; exclude lines start with a minus sign (-) in the first
column, followed immediately by the desired string.  Comment lines
start with a hash mark (#) in the first column and are ignored.

If a filter file is specified, only entries whose title lines contain
at least one of the include lines (ignoring uppercase/lowercase
distinctions) and none of the exclude lines are processed.  Thus, a
filter file must contain at least one include line, or INTPRINT will
skip all interrupt entries and print only the non-interrupt text in the
file.

All spaces on include and exclude lines are significant.  Thus,
	+ DOS
will only match entries containing the four-letter sequence " DOS",
while
	+DOS
will match any entries containing the sequence "DOS", whether or not it
is preceded by a blank.

EXAMPLES:
---------

        Print the interrupt list with page numbers, and create a summary file,
	without concatenating INTERRUP.A, INTERRUP.B, and INTERRUP.C:

		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p interrup.a >prn
		116 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]
		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p -n116 interrup.b prn
		261 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]
		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p -n261 interrup.c >prn
		386 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]

	or, more easily:
		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -m -p interrup.a prn
		942 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]

        Create only a summary file:

		C> intprint -sinterrupt.sum interrup.lst nul

	Print only those entries containing the string "DOS", except
	those containing the string "DR-DOS"

		C> type dos
		+DOS
		-DR-DOS

		C> intprint -Fdos interrup.lst nul
		

        Print the interrupt list on an Epson FX80, using 54 lines per page and
        omitting both page numbers and summary:

		C> intprint -Pepson -l54 interrup.lst >prn

	Print the interrupt list using 120 lines on every 132-line page (using
	superscript mode, for example), and make divider lines using IBM
	character graphics:

		C> intprint -I -l120 -L132 interrup.lst >prn

	Print only pages 123 through 127, assuming that 106 pages are contained
	in the first section of the list:

		C> intprint -n106 -r123:127 interrup.b prn

	Print using HP PCL4/5 escape sequences, numbering pages, from file
	"interrup.lst" to file "interrup.pcl", at the default 69 lines per
	page, using form-feeds:

		C> intprint -Php -p interrup.lst >interrup.pcl
		942 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]

PORTABILITY:
------------

INTPRINT.C contains the source code for INTPRINT, for those people who are
using the interrupt list on a machine which does not run MSDOS.  This code has
been tested with Turbo C and Mach (BSD 4.3 Unix) "cc".
