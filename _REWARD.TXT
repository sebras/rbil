This is your chance to get your name in print and possibly a free book
as well!

Jim Kyle and I are starting work on a second edition of PC Interrupts,
which should be available by Christmas.  As with the first edition, all
contributors will be listed in the book (unless someone at the publisher
drops the list from the final manuscript again), and major contributors
will be offered a complimentary copy of the finished book.  Due to the
size of the interrupt list, it will actually appear as two related
books: PC Interrupts, 2nd edition and Network Interrupts.

Anyone listed as a major contributor between June 1991 and the time we
freeze the manuscript (mid-June 1993) will be entitled to a free copy of
either PC Interrupts or Network Interrupts (the latter if you made a
contribution of networking calls, the former if non-networking, and your
choice if you contributed toward both).  I will be contacting those who
are eligible for a free copy in July or August to get a mailing
address, but feel free to send your address even before you hear from
me (especially if your email address has changed).
