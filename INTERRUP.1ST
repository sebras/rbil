Interrupt List
Release 88.9   Last change 12/17/88

Please distribute all of the following files together in an archive called
INTER988:
        INTERRUP.1ST   this file
        INTERRUP.LST   the actual list, 162 pages at 60 lines per page
        INTERRUP.SUM   a one-line-per-function summary, 15 pages
        INTERRUP.PRI   a brief primer on interrupts
---------------------------------------------
If the list is more than ten weeks old by the time you get it, there is
probably a newer release out already.  The newest release of this list is
available in these places:

On the ARPAnet, by standard anonymous FTP from CS.CMU.EDU.  You want file
	/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/interrup.zoo which is a link to the
	current version.
On FIDOnet, on the Second Opinion 1:129/31 1-412-826-0822 as file INTERnyy.ZOO,
        where nyy stands for the release n of year yy.  File Requests 23 hrs.

The list is also posted to USEnet in either comp.sys.ibm.pc or
comp.binaries.ibm.pc several times per year, concurrent with a new release of
the list.  Since comp.binaries.ibm.pc is archived, you will be able to find a
somewhat recent (< 6 months old) release in the various UUCP archives.

Secondary Distribution Points:
ARPA:	on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as file INTERnyy.ARC in directory
	PD1:<MSDOS.SYSUTL>, where nyy stands for release n of year yy.  Note
        that you must use mode "tenex" or "type L 8" to successfully FTP the
	file.
BITnet: you may retrieve the copy on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL via
        (in the US) LISTSERV@RPICICGE or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1
        (in Europe) TRICKLE at TREARN (Turkey)

Information on Tseng/Ahead/Paradise EGA video modes from a list posted by
Dan Kegel 3/87.

Information on the INT 10h functions supported by the EGA BIOS was derived
from the article "Graphic Enhancement" found in the April 1985 _PC Tech
Journal_, pages 58ff., and is marked with the string (EGA). jrh.

Information on functions unique to the Portable PC and the Convertible was
derived from a similar list compiled by David E. Powell, and added by
Ralf Brown 11/14/87.

Information on LIM EMS 3.2 functions was derived from _Advanced_MSDOS_, by
Ray Duncan. Added by Ralf Brown 11/19/87.

Information on LIM EMS 4.0 functions was derived from the transcription of
the specification by Dick Flanagan.  Added by Ralf Brown, 11/20/87

Some of the information on MCGA/VGA BIOS calls was derived from _Byte_,
Volume 12 Number 12.

Various and sundry info on which machines support which calls was derived from
the BIOS comparison in _Byte_, Volume 12 Number 12 and added by Ralf Brown,
1/4/88.

COMPAQ DOS 3.31 INT 25/26 from a posting by John Lefor, 1/25/88.

TopView INT 15/AH=12h info from macro definitions by Daniel T. Travison Jr.
Added 3/4/88.  Some additional TopView INT 15 info gleaned from "glue" routines
by John Navas.

Quarterdeck's flyer on its overpriced API specs and tools provided sufficient
clues as to functionality to allow figuring out a large number of DESQview
INT 15h calls.

MS Mouse driver calls derived from PC Magazine, Vol 6 #13.  Added 3/29/88.

Non-video PS/2 BIOS calls derived from _IBM_ROM_BIOS_ by Ray Duncan.
Added by Ralf Brown, 7/6/88.

EEMS function calls derived from PC Tech Journal, May 1987.  Added by Ralf
Brown, 7/11/88.

The list of functions used by Novell NetWare was taken from Novell's
"NetWare Function Call Reference".

PC Mouse information derived from the "PC Mouse Reference Manual version 4.00"

10-Net INT 6Fh information derived from "10-Net Reference Manual version 2.0"

APPC/PC INT 68h information derived from "Advanced Program-to-Program
Communication for the IBM Personal Computer, Programming Guide", second
edition, Dec 1986.

CDROM function call information derived from "Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM
Extensions Function Requests", dated May 28, 1988.  Added by Ralf Brown,
9/19/88.

Novell NetWare function names from a 9/23/88 post by Marc Guyott
<mguyott@mirror.TMC.COM>.  Added 9/30/88.

Miscellaneous data structures contributed by Helmut Waelder derived from
descriptions in "MS-DOS Encyclopedia".

Additional 10-Net INT 6F info from 10-Net version 3.3.10.

Additional Novell NetWare info from "Advanced NetWare 2.0 Reference".

Three miscellaneous calls from an info package by Dave Williams.  I do wish
he'd given this list more credit than
   "various text files downloaded from BBS systems - INTERRUP.ARC, BIOSDOS.ZOO,
   DOSINFO.ARC, DOSERROR.DOC, DOSTIPS.TXT, etc."
considering that most of his interrupt listing is derived from this one (a
majority of that with only formatting changes), AND he's asking a $15 shareware
registration.

Compaq speed setting calls derived from the Compaq DeskPro 386 Technical
Reference Guide.

TesSeRact RAM-resident API calls derived from the documentation to the 
TesSeRact library v1.0, available on BBSs as TESS_10.ARC.  Added by Ralf Brown,
11/29/88.
---------------------------------------------
What they're saying about this list:
  "A cornucopia of descriptions of interrupt and function calls on the
   IBM PC.  A great thing to have on your hard disk if you don't have
   a Ray Duncan or Peter Norton book handy."
      _Turbo_Technix_, July/August 1988, p. 157.
[and that was about the 1/30/88 version, which is less than half the size of
 the current version....]

If you know of any information not in the list, or which is stated incorrectly,
please let me know!  This list would be a pale shadow of its current self if it
weren't for everybody's input.
