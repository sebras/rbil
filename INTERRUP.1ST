Interrupt List		Release 26 (v91.3)		Last change 6/15/91

Please redistribute the following files unmodified as a group, in a pair of
archives named INTER26A and INTER26B (preferably the original authenticated
PKZIP archives):
        INTERRUP.1ST	this file
	INTERRUP.A	INT 00 through INT 14 \
	INTERRUP.B	INT 15 through INT 1F  \ total 599 pages at 60 lines
	INTERRUP.C	INT 20 through INT 2E  / per page, 648 with INTPRINT -p
	INTERRUP.D	INT 2F through INT 5F /
	INTERRUP.E	INT 60 through INT FF/
        INTERRUP.PRI	a brief primer on interrupts
	INTPRINT.COM	a simple formatter that also generates a list summary
	INTPRINT.DOC	instructions for INTPRINT
	INTPRINT.C	source code for INTPRINT
	MEMORY.LST	format of the BIOS data area
	INT2QH.*	program to convert list into QuickHelp database
	INT2GUID.*	program to convert list into TurboPower GUIDE database

Concatenate INTERRUP.A, .B, .C, .D, and .E with
  COPY /B INTERRUP.A+INTERRUP.B+INTERRUP.C+INTERRUP.D+INTERRUP.E INTERRUP.LST
to create an interrupt list file identical to my master copy.

Use INTPRINT to generate a one-line-per-call summary file and/or a file
containing only data structure formats.  See INTPRINT.DOC for details.

INT 0A"Tandy", INT 0D"Tandy", and INT 86"NetBIOS" have been completely
rewritten.  All other information contained in the July 1987 version on which
the above copyright is now (March 1991) claimed has been removed and replaced
with independently-obtained new versions.  Any similarities between the July
1987 entries and their replacements are due solely to the nature of the
information or the use of identical reference materials.
---------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER:  THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED "AS IS".  I verify the information
contained in this list to the best of my ability, but I cannot be held
responsible for any problems caused by use or misuse of the information,
especially for those functions not officially documented.  If it is marked
"internal", you should check it carefully to make sure it works the same
way in your version of the software (and please let me know whether or not
it works the same way).  Information marked with "???" is known to be
incomplete or guesswork.
---------------------------------------------
If the list is more than three months old by the time you get it, there is
probably a newer release out already (v91.3 is planned for late June).  Each
release supercedes all previous versions, so there is no need to keep old
versions.

The newest release of this list is available in these places (please do not
ask me to email it, it is just too large for that):

On the Internet, by standard anonymous FTP from CS.CMU.EDU [128.2.222.173].
	Change directly to directory /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub and get the
	files inter??a.zip and inter??b.zip.  You MUST change directory first
	because of the way CMU's anonymous FTP works.  Don't forget to set
	mode "binary" or "type L 8"!  ZIP unarchivers for MSDOS and BSD Unix
	are available in the "archivers" subdirectory.  Note that my directory
	is occasionally unavailable due to fileserver downtime.  If you get
	an "access denied" type error, try again in a few hours.

On FIDOnet, from SoundingBoard BBS 1:129/26 1-412-621-4604 1200/2400/14.4 HST
	as files INTERrrA.ZIP and INTERrrB.ZIP, where rr stands for the
	release number, in file area #4.  First-time callers may download.
	File Requests.

The list is also posted to USEnet in comp.binaries.ibm.pc about three times per
year, concurrent with a new release of the list.  Since comp.binaries.ibm.pc is
archived, you will be able to find a fairly recent release in the various UUCP
archives.

Secondary Distribution Points (the list will be available here within a day or
so of release):
Internet: on WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL [26.2.0.74] as files INTERrrA.ZIP and
	INTERrrB.ZIP in	directory PD1:<MSDOS.INFO>, where rr stands for the
	release number.  Note that you must use mode "tenex" or "type L 8" to
	successfully FTP the files.
FIDO:	SyncPoint BBS 1:261/1008 1-301-529-2584 File Requests.

considering that most of his interrupt listing is derived from this one (a

What they're saying about this list:
  "A cornucopia of descriptions of interrupt and function calls on the
   IBM PC.  A great thing to have on your hard disk if you don't have
   a Ray Duncan or Peter Norton book handy."
      _Turbo_Technix_, July/August 1988, p. 157.
[and that was about the 1/30/88 version, which is about one-eighth the size
 of the current version....]
---------------------------------------------
If you know of any information not in the list, or which is stated incorrectly,
please let me know!  This list would be a pale shadow of its current self if it
weren't for everybody's input.

Software developers are encouraged to check the list before assigning 
interrupts, and to provide me with a list of interrupt calls used (to help
prevent future interrupt conflicts).
