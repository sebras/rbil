  INTERVUE is a viewer for the Interrupt List maintained by Ralf Brown.  
  The program is Public Domain Software and may be freely copied and 
  distributed.  The Interrupt List is avaliable for downloading from
  CompuServe and numerous other BBS's.  The files are named INTnnA.ZIP,
  INTnnB.ZIP, and INTnnC.ZIP (nn = current release no.).  
  
  INTERVUE is provided as a 'no frills' alternative to the commercial 
  Interrupt List viewers.  The primary design critera were compatibity with 
  all operating environments and small executable size.  No modification to 
  the Interrupt List files is required for using the viewer.

  Version 1.4a contains an improved search alogrithm for the List entries,
  case insensitive search, expanded technical documentation, and a Windows
  Icon.
 
  INTERVUE is designed to be backward and foward compatible with the 
  Interrupt List releases, subject to the following constraints: 

        The Summary File format must be compatible with release 32.
        The individual List files size must not exceed 7 segments (458Kb).
        The number of List files must not exceed 15.
        The INTERRUP.A file header format must be consistent with release 32.
        
  To install INTERVUE, first copy the Interrupt List files, INTnnA.ZIP and 
  INTnnB.ZIP, to a subdirectory on the fixed disk and UNZIP them.  Next, use 
  INTPRINT to create the Summary File (INTERRUP.SUM) with the following 
  command:

        INTPRINT -sINTERRUP.SUM -m -i INTERRUP.A nul

  Copy INTERVUE to the Interrupt List directory and execute the program.  
  The INTERRUP.SUM file serves as the menu for accessing the function 
  descriptions contained in the Interrupt List files (INTERRUP.?).  To run 
  INTERVUE from a search path, add the following command to the AUTOEXEC.BAT 
  file:

        set intervue = drv:\path

  The 'drv:\path' is the drive and path where the Interrupt List files are
  located.  INTERVUE may then be placed in any active search path.

  The following keys are active within the INTERVUE text display window:
  Home, End, PageUp, PageDn, UpArrow, DnArrow, Tab, Shift-Tab, Esc, F1, 
  F2, F3, Ctrl-C, & Enter.

  INTERVUE is written in 8086 assembler, uses conventional memory (640Kb)
  only, compatible with DOS 2.0 & >, RSIS compliant (DESQview aware), and 
  is compatible with both mono and color video.  Requires 3Mb disk space
  for the Interrupt List files (unzipped).  INTERVUE has no command line
  parameters, does not use a setup file, and makes no disk writes.

                          Search Alogrithm:

  At initialization, the environment is checked for a path to the Interrupt
  List files.  If none is found, the default path is used.  INTERRUP.A is 
  opened and the first 1680 bytes of text are read to build an array mapping 
  Int, Fct, & Sub to the INTERRUP file extension.  Next, INTERRUP.SUM is read 
  into the file buffer and displayed as a menu.  When a function is selected 
  (Enter), the List file with the Int, Fct, & Sub is read into the buffer and 
  searched for a match.

  The search string is formed from the Summary file entry by re-creating
  the List file description line (three format variations).  The List
  file description line does not contain the Fct & Sub, so a verify string 
  is created to check the List file dashed line above the description for 
  Int, Fct & Sub.  A hit is returned from verify if either a match is 
  found, or if Int, Fct & Sub are absent from the dashed line above the 
  description (some with Int only are missing).  The verify compare allows 
  List file formatting fluctuations of + or - 5 bytes.  

  The only observed search problem occurs from identical entries (Int, Fct,
  Sub, & description) in the Summary file.  The search will always find the 
  first of these entries in the List file.  Use of F3 (next match) will 
  reveal all of the subsequent identical description entries in the List file, 
  which will show unique values in BX or other registers.  With the 'feature' 
  documented, and with awareness of how the search works, this should be a
  minor inconvience. 
   
  The List file is always searched sequentially from the beginning in order 
  to count the newlines and display the tally.  No pointers are used with  
  the List files, and no binary search techniques are used.  The file buffer
  segment offset is incremented by one following each byte compare, and
  tested for zero to identify segment boundaries.  The aux timer vector is
  unhooked/hooked and start/end crit section (2F 16 81-82 & 15 DE 1C-1B) is 
  called for file reads and the search.  A time slice is released for DPMI
  (Windows) and DESQview in idle loops.  The file reads are 8000h, with a 
  compare of AX, CX for eof.  

  Memory is released, retaining 16Kb for the program, and 7 segs allocated  
  for the file buffer.  Errors trapped are mem allocation, file too big, file 
  not found, checksum, and crit.  Stack seg is 512 bytes.
  
  Please report any INTERVUE bugs or problems, and upgrade suggestions.
