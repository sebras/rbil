--------N-2F8000-----------------------------
INT 2F - EASY-NET - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
Return: AL = 00h not installed
	     FFh installed
Program: EASY-NET is a shareware two-machine serial-port network
--------N-2F8000-----------------------------
INT 2F - Nanosoft, Inc. TurboNET server - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
Return: AL = FFh if installed
	    BX = CS of resident code
	    CX = ??? (03FCh)
Program: TurboNET is a NetBIOS-based file redirector and server; a
	  demonstration version may be downloaded from Nanosoft's BBS
SeeAlso: AX=8100h
----------2F8000-----------------------------
INT 2F - ASCII v2.00 - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
	DS:SI -> 4-byte signature (11h 43h 53h 10h)
Return: AL = status
	    01h installed, but signature did not match
	    FFh installed, signature matches
		ES:DI -> resident copy of signature (may be followed by data)
Program: ASCII is a popup ASCII table by Nick Zaikin, Jr.
Note:	the interface used by this program appears to be a general-purpose
	  interface which may be shared by multiple programs, so other programs
	  may also support this call with differing signatures
SeeAlso: AX=8001h"ASCII",AX=8002h"ASCII"
--------F-2F8000DX0000-----------------------
INT 2F - FaxBIOS interface - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
	DX = 0000h
	DI = 0000h
Return: AL = FFh if installed
	DX:DI -> signature "FaxBiosjpc"
Note:	FaxBIOS may use any multiplex number from 80h through FFh; to determine
	  whether it is installed, it is necessary to poll all multiplex
	  numbers for one which returns the above signature
SeeAlso: AH=2Ah,AX=80FBh
--------N-2F8001-----------------------------
INT 2F - Nanosoft, Inc. TurboNET server - ???
	AX = 8001h
	DS:SI -> 16-byte buffer for ???
Return: AH = status
	    00h successful
	    01h error (TurboNET busy)
Note:	makes NetBIOS calls
----------2F8001-----------------------------
INT 2F - ASCII v2.00 - INSTALLATION VERIFICATION
	AX = 8001h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ signature string "ASCII 2.00 by Nick Zaikin Jr."
Return: BX = 0000h if signature did not match
	   = instance number??? if signature matched
	       ES:DI -> ??? (same as returned by AX=8000h)
Note:	the interface used by this program appears to be a general-purpose
	  interface which may be shared by multiple programs, so other programs
	  may also support this call with differing signatures
SeeAlso: AX=8000h"ASCII",AX=8002h"ASCII"
----------2F8002-----------------------------
INT 2F - ASCII v2.00 - ???
	AX = 8002h
	BX = instance number??? (value returned by AX=8001h)
Return: ES:DI -> ??? (same as returned by AX=8000h) if instance number matches
	call chained if instance number did not match
SeeAlso: AX=8000h"ASCII",AX=8001h"ASCII"
--------F-2F80FB-----------------------------
INT 2F - FaxBIOS interface - COMMAND SUBMISSION
	AX = 80FBh
	BX = function number (see below)
	DX:DI -> command buffer (see below)
Return: AL = FFh if submitted OK
	CX = result code (see below)
Note:	FaxBIOS may use any multiplex number from 80h through FFh
