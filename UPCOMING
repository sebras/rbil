Planned enhancements:

INTER41 will add a new keyword Range: which will look something like
Range:	AH=C0h to AH=FFh, selected by commandline switch
and will replace the existing Note: entries

INTER42 will start phasing in finer-grained cross-references when tables
are involved.  Instead of referencing the entry containing the table,
the table itself will be referenced by number.  This will look something
like
		... (see #0768)

Format of ...:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 0768)
 00h	...
